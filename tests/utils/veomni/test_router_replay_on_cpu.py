"""Unit tests for ``verl.utils.veomni.router_replay.VeOmniRouterReplay``.

Pure-CPU coverage for the controller state machine. The patched
``SparseMoeBlock`` integration (the actual end-to-end forward through a
real router) lives in VeOmni's invariant test suite; the engine-driver
glue (snapshot side-channel + nested rebuild) lives in
``tests/workers/test_router_replay_engine_helpers_on_cpu.py``.

What's covered
--------------
* RECORD lifecycle (single mb, multi-mb).
* Recompute under whole-model AND per-layer activation checkpointing.
  Per-layer checkpointing fires backward recompute for each layer
  *independently in reverse order* — the failure mode that breaks any
  monotonic-cursor design.
* REPLAY first step (R3 case): set_microbatch_targets must work
  before any RECORD has populated the id table.
* REPLAY strict missing-target error path.
* Snapshot clone semantics.
* id-mapping stability across micro-batches.
* ``install`` / ``uninstall`` against a stubbed VeOmni hook surface.
